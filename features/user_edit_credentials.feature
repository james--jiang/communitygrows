Feature: successfully edit email or password as a logged in user
  
  As an existing user
  I should be able to edit my credentials
  So that I can choose a password without the admin knowing
  
Background:
  Given the following users exist:
    | name   | email             | admin      | created_at           | password     | password_confirmation     |
    | Zach   | zach@gmail.com    | true       | 2016-03-17 17:44:13  | 12341234     | 12341234                  |
    | Tony   | tonylee@gmail.com | false      | 2016-03-14 15:32:00  | 43124312     | 43124312                  |
    | Jae    | jae@berkeley.edu  | false      | 2016-03-18 22:12:11  | 54175417     | 54175417                  |  

  Given "zach@gmail.com" logs in with password "12341234"
  And I am on the CommunityGrows home page
  When I follow "Account Details"

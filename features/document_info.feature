Feature: Document Info Page
  
  As a user
  I want to visit the document information page
  So that I can see and modify a document's information and properties
 
Background: user is on the document repository page
  Given a logged in user
  And a category called "Ctgy"
  And I am on the document repository page 
  When I follow "Add new file"
  Then I fill in "Title" with "schedule"
  Then I fill in "URL" with "mock.com/schedule"
  And I select "Ctgy" from "Category"
  And I press "Submit"
  Then I should be on the document repository page
  And I should see "schedule"
  When I follow "schedule"
 
Scenario: Navigates to Info Page for Document
  Then I should be on the doc info page for "schedule"

Feature: Admin dashboard contains all necessary features
  
  As a user
  I want to make sure everything I want is on the Admin dashboard
  So I can view user management and announcement tools 
  
Background: users in database
  
  Given the following users exist:
    | name   | email             | admin      | created_at           | password     | password_confirmation     |
    | Zach   | zach@gmail.com    | true       | 2016-03-17 17:44:13  | 12341234     | 12341234                  |
    | Tony   | tonylee@gmail.com | false      | 2016-03-14 15:32:00  | 43124312     | 43124312                  |
